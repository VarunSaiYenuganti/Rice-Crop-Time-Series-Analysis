Rice Crop Time Series Analysis
 Overview:

This project analyzes historical rice crop production data to identify trends, seasonality, and fluctuations. It uses ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models to forecast future rice yields, helping improve agricultural planning and decision-making.

 Dataset:

Contains multi-year rice production data including:

Geographic details,
Climate factors,
Cultivation practices,
Yield measurements

 Preprocessing:

Removed missing values & outliers,
Normalized data,
Ensured data integrity,
Extracted additional useful features

EDA:

Statistical summaries,
Time series plots & trend visuals,
Seasonal and pattern analysis

Models Used:

ARIMA – trend forecasting,
SARIMA – seasonal forecasting,
LSTM – deep learning for long-term patterns

Evaluation:

Metrics used:

MAE,
MSE,
RMSE,
R² Score,

Key Insights:

Rice production shows a strong long-term upward trend.
Noticeable yearly fluctuations due to climate and policy changes.
Significant growth during 1970s–80s.
Recent years show record-high production.
